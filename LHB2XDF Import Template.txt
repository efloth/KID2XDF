		TCDASU 	 Filter constant used when TP is greater  than  the  filtered  TP value   (DSTPBR).    The   larger  the  time  constant  the  more  slowly pre-position airflow will be available  to  respond  to  tip  in/tip  out actions.

		MINMPH 	 Minimum speed to enter C/L  RPM  control.   Applies  to  systems having  VSS.   Should be set below the speed at which an automatic trans. vehicle rolls along in drive without the  brakes.   This  is  to  prevent going into RPM control during parking lot maneuvers.																																								
		NDIF 	 The deviation in engine speed allowed  over  the  ISCTM  specified time  interval.   Values  too  small could lock the ISC system out of C/L speed control indefinitely.  Values too large invalidate the check.																																								
		RPMCTL 	 Added to DSDRPM.  The total defines the engine  speed  threshold below  which entry into C/L RPM control is allowed.  This value should be reasonably small to avoid inadvertent entry into C/L ISC.

A  large  value  of   TC_OVER corresponds to a small integral gain, a small value corresponds to a high gain."																																								
		TC_UNDER 	" Time constant used to control the integral gain (or pacing) of the  term,  IPSIBR.   TC_UNDER  is used when RPMERR_A > 0, i.e., when the actual  speed  is  lower  than  desired.
